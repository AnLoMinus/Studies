# **All Areas of Math**

Mathematics is a broad and diverse field that encompasses many different areas of study. Here are some of the major areas of mathematics:

## **1. Arithmetic**

Arithmetic is the study of basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as number theory and properties of numbers.

## **2. Algebra**

Algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols to solve equations and describe relationships between variables.

## **3. Geometry**

Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, and positions of objects in space, as well as the properties of lines, angles, and curves.

## **4. Trigonometry**

Trigonometry is the study of the relationships between angles and sides of triangles, as well as the properties of trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent.

## **5. Calculus**

Calculus is the study of rates of change and how things change over time. Calculus includes differential calculus, which studies how things change instantaneously, and integral calculus, which studies how things change over time in a cumulative way.

## **6. Probability and Statistics**

Probability and statistics is the study of the likelihood of events and the analysis of data. Probability and statistics are used in many areas, including science, engineering, economics, and social sciences.

## **7. Combinatorics**

Combinatorics is the study of counting, combinations, and permutations. Combinatorics is used in many areas, including computer science, cryptography, and optimization.

## **8. Logic**

Logic is the study of reasoning and argumentation. Logic is used in many areas of mathematics, including proof theory, set theory, and model theory.

## **9. Number Theory**

Number theory is the study of the properties of numbers, especially integers. Number theory is used in many areas, including cryptography and coding theory.

## **10. Topology**

Topology is the study of the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations, such as stretching and bending.

These are just a few of the many areas of mathematics. There are many more specialized fields and subfields within mathematics, as well as interdisciplinary areas that involve mathematics in combination with other fields like physics, engineering, and computer science.
