# [C Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_overview.htm) - Overview
- C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. 
- Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. 
- C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.

> - In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. 
- C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons âˆ’
   - Easy to learn
   - Structured language
   - It produces efficient programs
   - It can handle low-level activities
   - It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms

# Facts about C
- C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
- C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
- The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
- The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
- Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
- Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
- Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.


# Why use C?
- C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. 
- C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. 

# Some examples of the use of C might be:
  - Operating Systems
  - Language Compilers
  - Assemblers
  - Text Editors
  - Print Spoolers
  - Network Drivers
  - Modern Programs
  - Databases
  - Language Interpreters
  - Utilities

# C Programs
- A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension "`.c`"; for example, `hello.c`. You can use "`vi`", "`vim`" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
