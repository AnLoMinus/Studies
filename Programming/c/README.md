# [C Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm)
> **C programming** is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. 

> Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. 

> It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.

# Why to Learn C Programming?
> **C programming** language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain.

> I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:
> - Easy to learn
> - Structured language
> - It produces efficient programs
> - It can handle low-level activities
> - It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms

# Facts about C
> - C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
> - C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
> - The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
> - The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
> - Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
> - Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.

# Hello World using C Programming.
> Just to give you a little excitement about **C programming**, I'm going to give you a small conventional C Programming Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   /* my first program in C */
   printf("Hello, World! \n");
   
   return 0;
}
```

# Applications of C Programming
> C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. 

> C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. 

> Some examples of the use of C are -
> - Operating Systems
> - Language Compilers
> - Assemblers
> - Text Editors
> - Print Spoolers
> - Network Drivers
> - Modern Programs
> - Databases
> - Language Interpreters
> - Utilities

# Audience
