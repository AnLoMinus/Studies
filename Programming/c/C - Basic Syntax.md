# [C Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_basic_syntax.htm) - Basic Syntax
> You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.

# Tokens in C
- A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. 
- For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens:
```c
printf("Hello, World! \n");
```
> The individual tokens are:
```c
printf
(
   "Hello, World! \n"
)
;
```
# Semicolons
- In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. 
- That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. 
- It indicates the end of one logical entity.
> Given below are two different statements:
```c
printf("Hello, World! \n");
return 0;
```
# Comments
- Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. 
> They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below:
```c
/* my first program in C */
```
