# [C Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_data_types.htm) - Data Types
- Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. 
- The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
> The types in C can be classified as follows:

| Sr.No. |                                                                           Types & Description                                                                          |

|    1   |                        Basic Types   They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.                        |
|    2   | Enumerated types   They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.  |
|    3   |                                             The type void   The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.                                              |
|    4   |                     Derived types   They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.                      |
