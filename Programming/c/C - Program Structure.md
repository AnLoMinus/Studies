# [C Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_program_structure.htm) - Program Structure

> Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.

# Hello World Example
- A C program basically consists of the following parts:
  - Preprocessor Commands
  - Functions
  - Variables
  - Statements & Expressions
  - Comments

- Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World":

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   /* my first program in C */
   printf("Hello, World! \n");
   
   return 0;
}
```
