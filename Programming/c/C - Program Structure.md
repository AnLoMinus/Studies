# [C Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_program_structure.htm) - Program Structure

> Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.

# Hello World Example
- A C program basically consists of the following parts:
  - Preprocessor Commands
  - Functions
  - Variables
  - Statements & Expressions
  - Comments

- Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World":

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   /* my first program in C */
   printf("Hello, World! \n");
   
   return 0;
}
```
- Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program:
  - The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
  - The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
  - The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
  - The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
  - The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.

# Compile and Execute C Program
- Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps âˆ’
  - Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
  - Save the file as `hello.c`
  - Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
  - Type `gcc hello.c -o Hello` and press enter to compile your code.
  - If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate `Hello` executable file.
  - Now, type `./Hello` to execute your program.
  - You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.

```c
$ gcc hello.c -o Hello
$ ./Hello
Hello, World!
```
> - Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.
