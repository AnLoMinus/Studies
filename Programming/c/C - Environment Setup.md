> If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) `Text Editor` and (b) The `C Compiler`.

# Text Editor
- This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include `Windows Notepad`, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, `EMACS`, and `vim` or `vi`.
- The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. 
  - For example, `Notepad` will be used on Windows, and `vim` or `vi` can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
- The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. 
- The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension "`.c`".
