# Assign Values to Variables
- Once we declare a variable, we can assign a value to it. 
> Let's see how to do that.
```c
// declare the variable
int age;

// assign the data 25 to it
age = 25;
```

- Here, we have used the `=` operator to assign the value `25` to the `age` variable.

# Declare and Assign Value together
- We can also assign values to variables during their declaration. 
> Let's see how:
```c
int age = 25;
```

- Here, we have created a variable and assigned a value to it in a single statement.
