## CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+) is an introduction to basic IT knowledge and skills.

### Why is it different?
- CompTIA ITF+ helps professionals to decide if a career in IT is right for them or to develop a broader understanding of IT.
  - ITF+ is the only pre-career certification that helps students or career changers determine if they have a competency for information technology and if it is the right career path for them.
  - ITF+ is the only single certification that covers all areas of IT foundations, creating a broader understanding of IT making it ideal for non-technical professionals.
  - ITF+ establishes an IT education framework for students in secondary and post-secondary settings.
