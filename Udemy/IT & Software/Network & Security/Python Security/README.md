### Description
- The title of this course is “Hacking with Python”, and it's a course for everyone interested in hacking or Python. 
- If you’re a hacker, you’re probably thinking: 
  - “But it’s not! Python is for business applications and engineering. Not for me! I hack on the command-line.”
- Ahem, I see what you did there: cute. But I have news for you: python is a great language to start learning now. 
- Why? Because it’s becoming one of the most popular languages in the world, and there are thousands of libraries written in it for you to use. 
- Plus, it’s easy to learn, powerful enough to handle complicated projects, runs everywhere, is one of the most popular languages today (literally!), and allows you to get things done quickly with great code that’s readable.
- In this course you will build several Python programs that investigate the attack surface like a subdomain scanner, directory scanner, port scanner and others. You will also use Python scripts that do SSH brute forcing and keyloggers.
- If you are a beginner and interested in Python or Hacking, this course is for you. 
- You don't need any prior knowledge to starting this course, not even of Python. It should be a lot of fun, so what are you waiting for?
