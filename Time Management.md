# How to write SMART goals
- S: [Specific]()
- M: [Measurable]()
- A: [Actionable]()
- R: [Relevant]()
- T: [Time Bound]()

## [S]: Specific
#### Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
Your goal should be clear and specific, otherwise you won't be able to focus your efforts or feel truly motivated to achieve it.  

- In order for a goal to be effective, it needs to be specific. A specific goal answers questions like:
  - What needs to be accomplished?
  - Who’s responsible for it?
  - What steps need to be taken to achieve it?

- When drafting your goal, try to answer the five "W" questions:
  - **What** do I want to accomplish?
  - **Why** is this goal important?
  - **Who** is involved?
  - **Where** is it located?
  - **Which** resources or limits are involved?

---

## [M]: Measurable
#### Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
It's important to have measurable goals, so that you can track your progress and stay motivated. Assessing progress helps you to stay focused, meet your deadlines, and feel the excitement of getting closer to achieving your goal.

- A measurable goal should address questions such as:
  - **How** much?
  - **How** many?
  - **How** will I know when it is accomplished?

---

## [A]: Achievable
#### Achievable (agreed, attainable).

---

## [R]: Relevant 
#### Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).

---

## [T]: Time bound
#### Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).
